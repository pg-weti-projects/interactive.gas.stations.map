## INTERACTIVE MAP - GIS PROJECT

The web application allows users to display an interactive map with markers of fuel stations across Poland. Users can add their own markers, edit information about existing gas stations, and remove them. The application also provides a range of additional features such as filtering displayed indicators of gas stations, finding the route to the nearest station, or changing the style of the displayed map.
