## INTERACTIVE MAP - GIS PROJECT

Users can add their own markers, edit information about existing gas stations, and remove them. The application also provides a range of additional features such as filtering displayed indicators of gas stations, finding the route to the nearest station, or changing the style of the displayed map.
